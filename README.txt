DSF-PT08P3- Phase 3 project 
SyriaTel Project : Reducing customer Churn Through Predictive Analysis 

1. Project overview
SyriaTel is telecommunication company that is interested in reducing the number of customer churn/attrition to reduce loss of revenue. The project will enable the reduction of churn through analytics of historical data and development of machine learning models to predict customers who are likely to churn and develop a mitigation strategy.

2. Business and Data understanding
Telecom companies experience customer churn/attrition when customers voluntarily cease their relationship with the company. This leads to financial loss due to reduction in revenue and loss of market share. It is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to main existing ones. During churn the company also loses the future revenue from the customer and the resources spent to acquire the customer. Thus, reducing profitability. Beyond financial loss, high customer churn can indicate a deeper problem with the company in terms of customer service, product appeal or quality of processes. This can erode the company's reputation and further erode the market share.

Analytic of churn will provide insights on why customers churn and will help in identifying customers who are likely to leave so that a targeted strategy can be developed to convince them to stay

The objective of the project is to predict customer churn using public dataset with customer usage patterns and if the customer has churned or not.
